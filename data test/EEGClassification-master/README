Implementation of EEG signal classification.

This program has two stages:

First Stage is feature extraction method using Autoregression (AR), Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Power Spectral Density (PSD).

Second stage is classification of extracted features using Bagging, Boosting and AdaBoost methods.
