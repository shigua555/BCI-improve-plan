% // Input // %
% x:            the original data samples (Time Points x Channels)
% xtimes:       the time axis of the original data
% Fs:           sampling rate
% omega:        a parameter to define the central frequency of Morlet wavelet
% sigma:        a parameter to define the spread of Morlet wavelet in time domain

% // Output // %
% P:            squared magnitude of MWT (scaleogram)
% S:            complex values of Morlet wavelet transform
