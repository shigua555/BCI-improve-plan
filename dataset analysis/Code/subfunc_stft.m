% // Input // %
% x:        the original data samples (Time Points x Channels/Trials)
% winparam: for an positive interger input, winparam is the window size (default window is hamming)
%           for a vector input, winparam is a window
% nfft:     number of fft points
% fs:       sampling rate

% // Output // %
% P:        squared magnitude of STFT (spectrogram)
% f:        evaluated frequency bins in STFT
% S:        complex time-frequency value of STFT
